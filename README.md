## This is a project to learn React hooks.

We are using:

#### `useState` 
For component-specific states

#### `useEffect`
To fetch data from a public Pokemon API

#### `useContext` 
To manage state for multiple child components that depend on each other

#### `useReducer`
To store the state logic in 1 place using reducer functions
